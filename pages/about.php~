	<p class="ni">Heres where I write a little bit about me. Said I'd get round to it sometime...</p>
	
	<p>So, my name's Sam. Geek, web-designer, roleplayer, and occasionally good at coding. I'm currently in A-level education, studying Physics, Computing and Philosophy; and am planning to go to university for a Computer Science degree. I live in this tiny country next to England, that I'm told they call Wales. Lots of sheep, mountains and rain, although it manages to look pretty whenever the rain clears.</p>
	
	<p>On the web design front, I've handcrafted themes for a few sites, such as <a href="http://razor-studios.co.uk">Razor Studios</a> and <a href="http://bytecove.co.uk">Bytecove</a>. I'm pretty fluent in HTML, CSS and PHP, but JavaScript still looks like someone blew up a sites source code and mashed it together.</p>
